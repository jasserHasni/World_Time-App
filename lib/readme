1) so first of all i created a stateful widget in pages/home.dart that returns
Home widget with a text widget 'this is home' then i imported that file into main.dart and use
that Home() widget
2)the text widget returned by Home() widget isn't visible so i centered it in the start of the home
app using SafeArea() widget
3) making  a choose_location class that returns a text widget in the body propriety that contains
"choose location screen" and same for loading_screen
4)make pages with routing propriety in main.dart and make buttons to navigate using
Navigation.PushNamed("context",route) function
5)while redirecting from home to change_location.dart using pushnamed function we can navigate between
them both using a back icon that appeared automatically
6)i learned future.delayed method and how to use it :
--------------------------------------------
void getData() async {
      String test = await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds:3),
            (){
      return 'test1';
    }
    );
---------------------------------------
7) i added http in the depencies and uploaded the package and used jsondecode so i can get data from the api
8) i used worldwidetime api to get information about time and convert it to a data that i can use
using jsondecode and datetime type to get the real time for now
9)so i created in services.dart a WorldTimeApp Class that contains arguments to define any place and any time
then i created a function SetupWorldTime() that uses the WorldTimeApp class in loading.dart
10) i created an instance of that class and tried to see it in the app in the body
11) i used the try method in services.dart to assure that if i get an error getting the variable time i would print that error
12) so i used the Navigation.PushNamed function in the loading page and take the data with the arguments propriety
to the home page and get it via map after the build function using the function ModalRoute.of......
13)i strcutred the home page with some widgets and put on it the data i got from 12)
14)i added a package named flutter_spinkit.dart to design the loading page
15) i added a new variable isdaytime into the class defined in services so i can add a picture of night or day in the home page
16)i used the boxdecolaration widget in home page so i can give the picture of night or day in the background
17)i colored the backgroundcolor of the Scaffold widget to make it match to the picture
18)
